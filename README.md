# Why hello there!
I'm Wayne C., spotted across the interweb as **@wechanism**  
(that includes [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wechanism), Instagram, and Clubhouse, among others...)

Very, very much a rookie to Github & Programming & Developing, despite calling myself a tech lover.😅

## What am I all about?

- 🏘 **I live in New York City.** You'll also occasionally see me in Taipei, and that faux-utopia you dreamt about once in fifth grade.
- ✌️ I'm a big advocate of **Urbanism**, better **Architecture**, **Tech**, and **YIMBYism**
- 👨‍💻 Consequentially, I'm often on the intersection of urban planning, data science, GIS, and more forms of mapping in general
- 🔭 I'm quite curious and overly ambitious, so I'm fed by a slapdash of information diet that involves a lot of blockchain and economics content at the same time
- 📫 Aside from my social media handle **@wechanism**, find me by emailing **wc1380@stern.nyu.edu** ~~or my site-in-progress **wechanism.com**~~ (whenever it is ready)
